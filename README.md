taskfreak fork

Hi, I'm using Taskfreak from two or three years ago. I made many changes to the original code but is a poor Hell modify this code and finally I decide to make my own Taskfreak.

Actually I'm in development stage. I'm using CodeIgniter but I'm thinking to migrate to Laravel, I'm undecided on this.
